# Supermarket Sales Analysis and Forecasting in Power BI

Project Overview:
This project provides an in-depth analysis of supermarket sales data using Power BI. The dashboard includes various visualizations to explore key metrics like total sales, product categories performance, and customer segmentation. Additionally, a sales forecasting model is implemented to predict future trends based on historical data.



- **Sales Overview**: A detailed look at overall sales performance, including breakdowns by product category, region, and customer demographics.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualizations showing sales trends over time, highlighting seasonality and peaks in demand.
- **Sales Forecasting**: A forecasting model built using Power BI's built-in forecasting features to predict future sales.
- **Interactive Filters**: Filters to explore data by product category, date range, location, and more.


The dataset used for this analysis contains transactional data from a supermarket. It includes fields such as:
- Date of Sale
- Product Category
- Quantity Sold
- Sales Revenue
- Customer Information (Location, Demographics)

How to use:
1. Download the Power BI file (`Supermarket_Sales.pbix`) from this repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the dashboard using interactive filters and slicers.


This analysis reveals several important insights, including:
- **Top Selling Products**: Analysis of the most popular products and their contribution to overall revenue.
- **Customer Behavior**: Key customer demographics and buying patterns.
- **Forecasting**: Future sales predictions based on historical data trends.

Future Enhancement
- Integrate additional data sources such as supplier data for deeper insights into supply chain performance.
- Implement machine learning models to enhance the forecasting accuracy beyond Power BIâ€™s built-in features.
